## Pod Delete

It contains tunables to execute the `pod-delete` experiment. This experiment deletes the targeted pods for the specified `TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION` duration. 

### Common and Pod specific tunables

Refer the [common attributes](../common/common.md) and [Pod specific tunable](common.md) to tune the common tunables for all experiments and pod specific tunables. 

### Force Delete

The targeted pod can be deleted `forcefully` or `gracefully`. It can be tuned with the `FORCE` env. It will delete the pod forcefully if `FORCE` is provided as `true` and it will delete the pod gracefully if `FORCE` is provided as `false`.

Use the following example to tune this:

[embedmd]:# (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ispeakc0de/litmus/experiments-by-example/docs/experiments/categories/pods/pod-delete/force.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# tune the deletion of target pods forcefully or gracefully
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  appinfo:
    appns: "default"
    applabel: "app=nginx"
    appkind: "deployment"
  chaosServiceAccount: pod-delete-sa
  experiments:
  - name: pod-delete
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # provided as true for the force deletion of pod
        # supports true and false value
        - name: FORCE
          value: 'true'
        - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
          value: '60'
        
       
```

### Multiple Iterations Of Chaos

The multiple iterations of chaos can be tuned via setting `CHAOS_INTERVAL` ENV. Which defines the delay between each iteration of chaos.

Use the following example to tune this:

[embedmd]:# (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ispeakc0de/litmus/experiments-by-example/docs/experiments/categories/pods/pod-delete/chaos-interval.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# defines delay between each successive iteration of the chaos
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  appinfo:
    appns: "default"
    applabel: "app=nginx"
    appkind: "deployment"
  chaosServiceAccount: pod-delete-sa
  experiments:
  - name: pod-delete
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # delay between each iteration of chaos
        - name: CHAOS_INTERVAL
          value: '15'
        # time duration for the chaos execution
        - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
          VALUE: '60'
```

### Random Interval

The randomness in the chaos interval can be enabled via setting `RANDOMNESS` ENV to `true`. It supports boolean values. The default value is `false`.
The chaos interval can be tuned via `CHAOS_INTERVAL` ENV. 
- If `CHAOS_INTERVAL` is set in the form of `l-r` i.e, `5-10` then it will select a random interval between l & r.
- If `CHAOS_INTERVAL` is set in the form of `value` i.e, `10` then it will select a random interval between 0 & value.

Use the following example to tune this:

[embedmd]:# (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ispeakc0de/litmus/experiments-by-example/docs/experiments/categories/pods/pod-delete/randomness-interval.yaml yaml)
```yaml
# contains random chaos interval with lower and upper bound of range i.e [l,r]
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: engine-nginx
spec:
  engineState: "active"
  annotationCheck: "false"
  appinfo:
    appns: "default"
    applabel: "app=nginx"
    appkind: "deployment"
  chaosServiceAccount: pod-delete-sa
  experiments:
  - name: pod-delete
    spec:
      components:
        env:
        # randomness enables iterations at random time interval
        # it supports true and false value
        - name: RANDOMNESS
          value: 'true'
        - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
          value: '60'
        # it will select a random interval within this range
        # if only one value is provided then it will select a random interval within 0-CHAOS_INTERVAL range
        - name: CHAOS_INTERVAL
          value: '5-10' 
```
