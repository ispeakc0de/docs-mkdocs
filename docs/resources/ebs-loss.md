## EBS Loss By ID

It contains tunables to execute the `ebs-loss-by-id` experiment. This experiment detaches the given ebs volume matched by `EBS_VOLUME_ID` and `REGION`. It reattached the volume after waiting for the specified `TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION` duration.

### Common and AWS specific tunables

Refer the [common attributes](../common/common.md) and [AWS specific tunable](common.md) to tune the common tunables for all experiments and aws specific tunables.  

### Detach Volumes By ID

It contains comma separated list of volume IDs subjected to ebs detach chaos. It can be tuned via `EBS_VOLUME_ID` ENV.

Use the following example to tune this:
