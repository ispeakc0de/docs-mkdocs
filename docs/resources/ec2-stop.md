## EC2 Terminate By ID

It contains tunables to execute the `ec2-terminate-by-id` experiment. This experiment stops the given ec2 instance matched by `EC2_INSTANCE_ID` and `REGION`. It restarts the instance after waiting for the specified `TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION` duration.

### Common and AWS specific tunables

Refer the [common attributes](../common/common.md) and [AWS specific tunable](common.md) to tune the common tunables for all experiments and aws specific tunables.  

### Stop Instances By ID

It contains comma separated list of instances IDs subjected to ec2 stop chaos. It can be tuned via `EC2_INSTANCE_ID` ENV.

Use the following example to tune this:
